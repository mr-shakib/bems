## üîß Required Actions in Vercel

### Step 1: Clear Build Cache
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/mr-shakib/bems/settings/general
2. Scroll to "Build & Development Settings"
3. Click **"Clear Build Cache"**

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables
Go to: https://vercel.com/mr-shakib/bems/settings/environment-variables

**Required Variables (16 total):**

#### App Configuration (1)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = https://bems.space
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Must be `https://bems.space` (NOT localhost!)

#### Appwrite Client Variables (8)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT = https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT = 68a35934000d7fdba65d
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID = 68a35a0c003c1920a347
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_WORKSPACES_ID = 68a35a81002b38fabbf3
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECTS_ID = 68a35a2f00155fd39254
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_MEMBERS_ID = 68a35a71000b6cff830f
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_TASKS_ID = 68a9fdee00116a96e475
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_IMAGES_BUCKET_ID = 68a35c5d0009e6c6f5a2
```

#### Appwrite Server Variable (1) - SECRET
```
NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY = [Your API key starting with "standard_"]
```

#### Cloudinary Variables (6)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = dgn2nezo7
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET = bems_profile_pictures
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = 154781953695782
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = [Your secret]
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET = bems_profile_pictures
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = dgn2nezo7
```

### Step 3: Important Notes
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** include quotes around values in Vercel
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** include `#` comments
- ‚úÖ Select **Production, Preview, and Development** for each variable
- ‚úÖ Ensure variable names are EXACT (case-sensitive)

### Step 4: Redeploy
After verifying/adding all variables:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/mr-shakib/bems/deployments
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click **"..." menu** ‚Üí **"Redeploy"**
4. Check "Use existing build cache" is **UNCHECKED**
5. Click **"Redeploy"**

## üîç Verification After Deployment

### 1. Check Build Logs
Look for these success indicators:
```
‚úì Creating optimized production build
‚úì Compiled successfully
‚úì Collecting page data
‚úì Generating static pages
‚úì Build successful
```

### 2. Check Runtime Logs
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/mr-shakib/bems/logs
2. Filter by "Errors"
3. Should see NO errors after successful deployment

### 3. Test the Website
1. Visit: https://bems.space
2. Should see landing page (not 500 error)
3. Try signing up/signing in
4. Check browser console (F12) for any errors

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If you still see the error:

#### Problem 1: Build Cache
**Solution:**
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard:
Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Clear Build Cache ‚Üí Redeploy
```

#### Problem 2: Environment Variables Not Loading
**Symptoms:** 
- Build succeeds but runtime fails
- "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors

**Solution:**
1. Verify ALL 16 variables are set in Vercel
2. Check for typos in variable names
3. Ensure values don't have extra spaces
4. Redeploy (force new build)

#### Problem 3: Appwrite Connection Issues
**Symptoms:**
- "Unauthorized" errors
- "Invalid API key" errors

**Solution:**
1. Check Appwrite Console: https://cloud.appwrite.io
2. Go to your project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Platforms
3. Add web platform with hostname: `bems.space`
4. Add another platform with: `*.vercel.app` (for previews)
5. Update CORS settings if needed

#### Problem 4: Module Resolution Issues
**Symptoms:**
- "Cannot find module" errors
- "clientModules is undefined" errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Local test first:
npm run clean  # or: rm -rf .next
npm install
npm run build
npm start

# If works locally, commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Update Next.js config for production"
git push
```

---

## üìù Local Testing

Before deploying, test locally:

```powershell
# 1. Verify environment variables
node scripts/verify-env.js

# 2. Clean build
npm run clean

# 3. Fresh install
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm install

# 4. Build for production
npm run build

# 5. Start production server
npm start

# 6. Test in browser
# Visit: http://localhost:3000
```

If it works locally, it should work on Vercel.

---

## üÜò Emergency Rollback

If new deployment breaks everything:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/mr-shakib/bems/deployments
2. Find the last working deployment
3. Click **"..." menu** ‚Üí **"Promote to Production"**
4. This immediately reverts to working version

---

## üìû Next Steps If Still Broken

If the error persists after following all steps:

1. **Export Build Logs:**
   - Go to failed deployment
   - Copy full build log
   - Save as `build-log.txt`

2. **Export Runtime Logs:**
   - Go to Logs page
   - Filter by errors
   - Save as `runtime-errors.txt`

3. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Visit https://bems.space
   - Press F12
   - Go to Console tab
   - Screenshot any errors

4. **Verify Code Changes:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff
   ```
